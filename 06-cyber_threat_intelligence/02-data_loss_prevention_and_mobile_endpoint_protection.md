# Data Security and Protection

## What is Data Security and Protection?

Protecting the:
- Confidentiality
- Integrity
- Availability

Of Data:
- In transit
- At rest
	- Databases
	- Unstructured Data (files)
	- On endpoints

### What are we protecting against?

**Deliberate attack:**
- Hackers
- Denial of Service

**Inadvertent attacks:**
- Operator error
- Natural disaster
- Component failure

## Data Security Top Challenges

- Explosive data growth
- New privacy regulations (GDPR, Brazil’s LGPD etc.)
- Operational complexity
- Cybersecurity skills shortage

## Data Security Common Pitfalls

Five epic fails in Data Security:
- Failure to move beyond compliance
- Failure to recognize the need for centralized data security
- Failure to define who owns the responsibility for the data itself
- Failure to address known vulnerabilities
- Failure to prioritize and leverage data activity monitoring

## Industry Specific Data Security Challenges

### Healthcare

- Process and store combination of personal health information and payment card data.
- Subject to strict data privacy regulations such as HIPAA.
- May also be subject to financial standards and regulations.
- Highest cost per breach record.
- Data security critical for both business and regulatory compliance.

### Transportation

- Critical part of national infrastructure
- Combines financially sensitive information and personal identification
- Relies on distributed IT infrastructure and third party vendors

### Financial industries and insurance

- Most targeted industry: 19% of cyberattacks in 2018
- Strong financial motivation for both external and internal attacks
- Numerous industry-specific regulations require complex compliance measures

### Retail

- Among the most highly targeted groups for data breaches
- Large number of access points in retail data lifecycle
- Customers and associates access and share sensitive data in physical outlets, online, mobile applications

## Capabilities of Data Protection

**The Top 12 critical data protection capabilities:**
1) Data Discovery
	- Where sensitive data resides
	- Cross-silo, centralized efforts
2) Data Classification
	- Parse discovered data sources to determine the kind of data
3) Vulnerability Assessment
	- Determine areas of weakness
	- Iterative process
4) Data Risk analysis
	- Identify data sources with the greatest risk exposure or audit failure and help prioritize where to focus first
	- Build on classification and vulnerability assessment
5) Data and file activity monitoring
	- Capture and record real-time data access activity
	- Centralized policies
	- Resource intensive
6) Real-time Alerting
7) Blocking Masking, and Quarantining
	- Obscure data and/or blocking further action by risky users when activities deviate from regular baseline or pre-defined policies
	- Provide only level of access to data necessary
8) Active Analytics
	- Capture insight into key threats such as, SQL injections, malicious stored procedures, DoS, Data leakage, Account takeover, data tampering, schema tampering etc
	- Develop recommendations for actions to reduce risk
9) Encryption
10) Tokenization
	- A special type of format-preserving encryption that substitutes sensitive data with a token, which can be mapped to the original value
11) Key Management
	- Securely distribute keys across complex encryption landscape
	- Centralize key management
	- Enable organized, secure key management that keeps data private and compliant
12) Automated Compliance Report
	- Pre-built capabilities mapped to specific regulations such as GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, CCPA and so on
	- Includes:
		- Audit workflows to streamline approval processes
		- Out-of-the-box reports
		- Pre-built classification patterns for regulated data
		- Tamper-proof audit repository

# Mobile Endpoint Protection

**iOS**
- Developed by Apple
- Launched in 2007
- ~13% of devices (based on usage)
- ~60% of tablets worldwide run iOS/iPadOS
- MDM capabilities available since iOS 6

**Android**
- Android Inc. was a small team working on an alternative to Symbian and Windows Mobile OS.
- Purchased by Google in 2005 – the Linux kernel became the base of the Android OS. Now developed primarily by Google and a consortium known as **Open Handset Alliance.**
- First public release in 2008
- ~86% of smartphones and ~39% of tablets run some form of Android.
- MDM capabilities since Android 2.2.

### How do mobile endpoints differ from traditional endpoints?

- Users don’t interface directly with the OS.
- A series of applications act as a broker between the user and the OS.
- OS stability can be easily monitored, and any anomalies reported that present risk.
- Antivirus software can “see” the apps that are installed on a device, and reach certain signatures, but can not peek inside at their contents.

### Primary Threats To Mobile Endpoints

**System based:**
- Jailbreaking and Rooting exploit vulnerabilities to provide root access to the system.
- Systems that were previously read-only can be altered in malicious ways.
- One primary function is to gain access to apps that are not approved or booting.
- Vulnerabilities and exploits in the core code can open devices to remote attacks that provide root access.

**App based threats:**
- Phishing scams – via SMS or email
- Malicious code
- Apps may request access to hardware features irrelevant to their functionality
- Web content in mobile browsers, especially those that prompt for app installations, can be the root cause of many attacks

**External:**
- Network based attacks
- Tethering devices to external media can be exploited for vulnerabilities
- Social engineering to unauthorized access to the device

### Protection mobile assets

- **MDM:** Control the content allowed on the devices, restrict access to potentially dangerous features.
- **App security**: Report on the health and reliability of applications, oftentimes before they even make it on the devices.
- **User Training**

### Day-to-day operations

While it may seem like a lot to monitor hundreds, thousands, or hundreds of thousands of devices daily, much of the information can be digested by automated systems and action taken without much admin interactions.
